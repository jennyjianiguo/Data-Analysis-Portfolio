## My Projects

This repository contains various exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning projects.

**Global Covid Cases** (SQL)

This exploratory data analysis project looks at the growth of covid cases and vaccination numbers from 2020-2021. It reviews various country's infection, death, and vaccination rates to draw insights on the spread of the Coronavirus.

**IMDb Top Movies** (Python, SQL)

This is a web scraping and exploratory data analysis project that reviews IMDb's top 100 ranked movies. It extracts data from IMDb's web page using the Python libraries _BeautifulSoup_, _request_, and _pandas_. The SQL script then explores popular directors, film periods, and genres from the extracted data.
