# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Hello, I am Jenny Guo.

I am a data analyst, media-enthusiast, sustainability-activist, dancer, and student.

I love to learn about:
- good coding practices, engineering techniques, and machine learning methods
- media platforms and their algorithms' impact on political beliefs and mental health
- the role of data analysis in a business world

Much of my experience revolves around data visualization and exploratory data analysis, but I strive to continuously learn to gain a deeper understanding of the world through data to create and promote human-centered and socially responsible technology.
